# BlockChain-project_Sadgui

THIS PROJECT IS MADE BY SADGUI AHMED ABDELAZIZ STUDENT OF 2ND GROUP OF COMPUTER SCIENCE MOBILE APPS DEVELOPMENT,

in this project we did a small implementation of a basic blockchain written in Python. The goal was to understand how a blockchain works internally by coding the main parts ourselves without using external libraries or ready-made frameworks.

What This Project Shows :

it show that this small blockchain is not meant to be used as a real cryptocurrency, but it clearly demonstrates the core concepts:

hashing

linking blocks

proof-of-work mining

chain validation

immutability

It is a simple but effective way to understand the foundation behind larger systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

NOTE : i might have understood the work incorrectly that's why the code has an input option , and asks wether you want to change ( tamper ) a block after it got added to the block so it shows how important and secure the blockchain is, because if you decide to tamper the block inputed the hash would change which would lead to the block being invalid , the code also offers the option to show the blockchain & check its validity
